# get-verified

A Decentralized solution to get verified as a unique identity without having to share personal information across the internet

### How it works?

1. Sign in with your unique identifier, (Google, apple, email, brightid)

2. Ask your relative aura players that know you to evaluate you as a valid identity

3. Get a score based on those evaluations
